    "abstract": "Flexible wearable sensors have developed rapidly due to the urgent demands for human motion monitoring. Eutectogel-based soft materials have exhibited great potential for wearable sensing applications. However, it is still a challenge to develop multifunctional eutectogels with excellent mechanical properties, adhesion, self-healing, fatigue resistance and degradability. In this work, a multifunctional starch-based eutectogel was developed by a one-pot and in-situ photo-polymerization method. The eutectogel had excellent stretchability (2710%), high strength (5.43 MPa), toughness (94.38 MJ/m<sup>3</sup>), Young's modulus (10.23 MPa), adhesion, fatigue resistance (1000 cycles), degradability and a certain degree of self-healing ability. These properties were closely correlated to the synergistic effect among the amylopectin, polyacrylic acid and choline chloride via hydrogen-bond and electrostatic interactions. The mechanical properties of eutectogel can be adjusted by changing the starch content. A wearable sensor based on the eutectogel was realized accurate and stable monitoring of human joint motions. This study addressed the limitations of the dehydration and single function of the traditional hydrogels, and provides a novel way for the development of the multifunctional bio-based gels for next-generation flexible wearable devices.",

This review provides a comprehensive and current overview of chitosan-based approaches for diabetic ulcer management, focusing on both conventional and advanced biomaterials, including nanoparticles, hydrogels, nanofibers, microneedles, sponges, and 3D scaffolds. Special attention is given to stimuli-responsive chitosan systems designed to adjust drug release in response to specific cues, such as pH, reactive oxygen species, temperature, enzymes, or glucose levels. To underscore the translation potential, the review compiles commercialized products, recent patents, and clinical trials related to the management of diabetic ulcers based on chitosan formulations. Finally, the integration of AI-driven design with smart chitosan systems is proposed as a future direction towards personalized and predictive diabetic ulcer management.",

However, achieving both high strength and toughness after incorporating BC into hydrogels remains challenging.

Through the fiber salting-out effect of BC, PVA was induced to aggregate on the BC surface, forming more crystalline domains and thereby improving the mechanical properties of the hydrogels.

N-acetylcysteine (NAC), as an effective treatment drug approved for clinical application in ALI, has limitations such as a short half-life and the requirement for high-dose injections. Consequently, it is imperative to optimize new administration method of NAC and promote alternative therapeutic strategies for ALI. Herein, hydrogel patches ONC composed of oxidized chondroitin sulfate (OCS) and NAC-grafted CMCS were developed, and their reparative effects on APAP-induced ALI were investigated. ONC hydrogels exhibited excellent biocompatibility and appropriate biodegradability, and favorable hemostatic effects in the liver. In vitro experiments demonstrated that ONC could promote the proliferation and migration of hepatocytes, as well as the angiogenesis of HUVECs. By establishing an APAP-induced ALI model in mice, liver enzymes after ONC hydrogel patches treatment recovered to near-normal levels. Moreover, histological examination, RT-qPCR, and transcriptome sequencing results demonstrated that ONC patches could reduce the expression of inflammatory factors and apoptosis in the liver, while simultaneously activating antioxidant-related signaling pathways, thereby promoting the regeneration and functional repair of damaged tissues. Therefore, ONC hydrogel patches may be a promising alternative strategy for treating ALI.",

    "abstract": "Non-compressible hemorrhage remains a leading cause of trauma mortality, with ineffective management triggering infection, dysregulated inflammation, and multi-organ dysfunction. Herein, we report a multilayer nanofiber-reinforced alginate hydrogel (GT-F) combining rapid hemostasis, strong tissue adhesion, high mechanical resilience, and wound healing. The hydrogel matrix, composed of dopamine-modified methacrylate alginate (AMD) and gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA), was incorporated with tranexamic acid (TAX). The biomimetic multilayer nanofiber framework is constructed from hydrophobic polycaprolactone (PCL) and simultaneously encapsulates both the natural medicinal compound curcumin (Cur) and the quaternary ammonium antibacterial agent (HDEAB). Experimental results indicate that, within an optimal range, increasing AMD content enhances hydrogel crosslinking density, reducing pore size and equilibrium swelling. Compared to conventional GelMA hydrogel, compressive strength was nearly quadrupled, and tensile strength increased over threefold. In vitro and in vivo studies confirm that GT-F hydrogels exhibit excellent biocompatibility, degradability, rapid hemostasis (<30 s), and robust antimicrobial and antioxidant properties. In a rat liver puncture model, GT-F hydrogels markedly outperformed commercial gauze in hemostasis, reduced macrophage inflammatory infiltration, promoted proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) expression, accelerated wound repair, and exhibited anti-adhesion effects.

While culturing dermal fibroblasts for tissue engineering applications is well reported, there is limited research on culturing primary human pulmonary fibroblasts on granular hydrogels. In this study, we grafted RGD-peptides to alginate, formed microbeads, and investigated the ability of granular hydrogels to support the adhesion and growth of primary normal human dermal fibroblasts (NHDFs) and human pulmonary fibroblasts (HPFa). NHDFs adhered to linear RGD (linRGD)-alginate microbeads and spread on the bead surfaces with increased adhesion with increased peptide concentration (0.3-1.3 mM). In contrast, HPFa did not adhere to the linRGD-alginate microbeads. However, HPFa adhered and spread on flat linRGD-alginate gels, indicating that HPFa do respond to linRGD as an adhesion ligand. Supplementation of Mn<sup>2+</sup> resulted in cell adhesion to linRGD-alginate microbeads. Enhanced adhesion and spreading of HPFa to RGD-alginate microbeads were observed when using cyclic RGD. Hence, RGD-alginate microbeads is a promising material for structuring primary human dermal and pulmonary fibroblasts, showing the relevance of using alginate microbeads as scaffolds for 3D cultures with fibroblasts.",

This study investigates the potential of genipin-crosslinked gelatin and asiaticoside (ASI) as innovative biomaterials ink for wound healing. Hydrogels were prepared using different concentrations of gelatin (9% w/v and 10% w/v) and asiaticoside at 0.05% w/v, with genipin employed as a natural crosslinker to improve mechanical strength. Their physicochemical characteristics, which includes swelling ratio, water vapour transmission rate (WVTR), contact angle, porosity, enzymatic degradation, and surface roughness were systematically evaluated, along with mechanical and cytotoxicity properties. Incorporation of asiaticoside enhanced hydrogel hydrophilicity, reduce porosity, and improved swelling behaviour, while preserving biodegradability and overall structural stability. The WVTR values remained within the optimal wound healing range (1500-2500 g/m<sup>2</sup>h). Furthermore, asiaticoside-loaded hydrogels demonstrated excellent cytocompatibility, supporting fibroblasts viability at lower concentrations including live/dead assay tests that were conducted.

Therefore, we adopted a multiscale biomimetic design using mussel adhesion chemistry and the interfacial robustness of 3,4,5-trihydroxyphenylalanine (TOPA) in the tunicate epidermis to construct a biodegradable bilayer hydrogel membrane (PLCL-CSs@PADT). This design enables interfacial water displacement, robust tissue adhesion (21 kPa strength, 110 J m<sup>-2</sup> fracture energy), antibacterial hemostasis (>80%), and a topological hydrophobic barrier for adhesion prevention. Methacrylated gelatin is introduced as a photocurable interfacial bridging phase, achieving seamless mechanical continuity, while gradient cyclic elution eliminates residual monomers. The membrane rapidly achieved hemostasis in rat hepatic hemorrhage models (<20 s) and reduced blood loss by 83%. In postoperative abdominal adhesion models, the material completely prevented adhesion formation, attributed to the combined shielding effect of the outer layer and regulation of t-PA/PAI-1 expression. In vitro experiments demonstrated that the membrane exhibits a preliminary trend of controlled biodegradation over an 8-week period, aligning with typical soft-tissue healing timelines.

However, the wound thermal environment is easily disrupted even treated by the functional dressings with limited thermal adaptability, gradually hindering the process of wound healing. Herein, we propose an outdoor light-driven dual thermal management system sequentially employing cooling and heating dressings to optimize the temperature of wounds and accelerate wound healing. The cooling dressing integrates a light porous poly(vinyl alcohol)/SiO<sub>2</sub> aerogel exhibiting high solar reflectance (≈91.5%) and strong mid-infrared emissivity (≈95.6%) with a self-adhesive, antibacterial polyacrylamide/chitosan hydrogel. It achieves substantial coupled radiative and evaporative cooling in the outdoors, lowering the rat wound temperature by approximately 6 °C under direct sunlight. Conversely, the heating dressing of polyacrylamide/chitosan/CNT-COOH hydrogel can rapidly reach ≈45 °C under near-infrared irradiation (808 nm, 0.5 W cm<sup>-2</sup>), providing mild photothermal antibacterial effects. Critically, the sequential application of cooling and heating dressings in a wound model of SD rats notably enhanced skin regeneration.

Our aim was to investigate potential toxic effects of a novel antibiotic-loaded hydrogel on osteogenic cells and its antibacterial effect against staphylococci. A covalently cross-linked hyaluronic acid (HA)-based hydrogel was loaded with increasing concentrations of cefuroxime and vancomycin and their release was examined by UV spectrometry. Primary human (HoBs), mouse (MoBs) osteoblasts, or SaoS-2 cells were either exposed to the drug-loaded hydrogel or to antibiotics alone, followed by assessment of cell metabolism and proliferation. Antibacterial effects were evaluated against Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) and Staphylococcus epidermidis (S. epidermidis). Increasing concentrations of antibiotics did not affect cell metabolism in any osteogenic cell type, whereas cell proliferation remained unaltered in MoBs, was significantly reduced in SaoS-2, and was stimulated in HoBs. Cultures of MoBs and HoBs tolerated higher concentrations of vancomycin than SaoS-2. Antibiotic-loaded hydrogels did not exert toxic effects on HoBs. After 24 h, 16.8% of vancomycin and 70.8% of cefuroxime were released from the hydrogel. Cefuroxime-loaded hydrogels significantly inhibited growth of S. aureus but not of S. epidermidis, while vancomycin-loaded hydrogel had scarce effects on S. epidermidis. Loading HA-based hydrogel with antibiotics does not harm osteoblasts at clinically relevant concentrations but inhibits bacterial growth. Higher loading of vancomycin may be required due to its slow release while cefuroxime is released more rapidly. A resorbable, antibiotic-loaded hydrogel may be used for implant-related infections in orthopaedics.",

Comprehensive characterization of KRT included chemical composition (FTIR, DSC), charge properties (pI = 5.5; net negative charge = -15.43 µmol/g), porosity (89%), and rheology (shear-thinning, linear viscoelastic region up to 24.5% strain, thermal stability to 68°C). Ator release followed Korsmeyer-Peppas kinetics (r<sup>2</sup> > 95%), and finite element analysis validated experimental profiles (r<sup>2</sup> = 82%-95%) while estimating diffusivity reductions from 569 to 0.06 µm<sup>2</sup>/s within the gel matrix. In vitro assays confirmed CKRT biocompatibility (ISO 10993-5) and preserved Ator bioactivity, with EC<sub>50</sub> values of 208 µm for mesenchymal stem and 389 µm for fibroblast cell lines. These findings demonstrate that CKRT provides a robust platform for controlled anti-fibrotic drug delivery, supported by extensive physicochemical and mechanical characterization.",

    "journal": "Macromolecular bioscience",
    "authors": "Yenurkar, Shrivastava, Mandal",
    "abstract": "Wound healing is a complex and dynamic biological process involving multiple phases, including inflammation, proliferation, and tissue remodeling. Despite significant advances in therapeutic approaches, conventional wound healing treatments often suffer from limitations such as poor bioavailability of drugs, inadequate moisture retention, uncontrolled release profiles, and delayed tissue regeneration. To overcome these challenges, drug-loaded nanocrystals were incorporated into an alginate-based hydrogel matrix to develop a biocompatible and sustained-release wound dressing. Emodin, a natural anthraquinone compound with potent anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and antimicrobial properties, was used as the therapeutic agent. The combination of emodin nanocrystals with the alginate hydrogel resulted in a synergistic effect, providing enhanced drug stability, controlled release, and accelerated tissue regeneration. The developed NCs-hydrogel composite demonstrates significant potential as an advanced wound dressing material, offering an effective and biocompatible platform for promoting rapid wound healing.",

    "journal": "Journal of materials science. Materials in medicine",
    "authors": "Wu, Zhu, Meng",
    "abstract": "Despite ongoing research efforts, spinal cord injury (SCI) remains one of the most disabling neurological disorders where current therapies provide limited solutions that mostly address symptoms rather than true regeneration. The latest research indicates that exosome-loaded hydrogel systems could function as a dual-purpose treatment for spinal cord injury in regenerative medicine. Exosomes are tiny membrane-enclosed extracellular vesicles that carry multiple therapeutic biomolecules which help control inflammation while delivering neuroprotective and tissue regenerative properties. The structural support and controlled release capabilities of hydrogels allow them to encapsulate exosomes which leads to their stable and bioactive delivery to the injury site. This study evaluates recent progress in exosome-loaded hydrogel technology for spinal cord injury repair by examining SCI mechanisms and the advantages of combining exosomes with hydrogels to develop optimized delivery systems. Our discussion will cover both the challenges of standardizing exosome production and hydrogel formulation as well as the scalability of these systems for in vivo applications. The following review will provide a summary of this novel SCI treatment approach and set out research directions to develop a therapy that is efficient, scalable, and translatable to humans.",
